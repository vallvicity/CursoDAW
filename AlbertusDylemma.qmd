## Introduction


::: {.summary}
As a future developer I want to relate the struggles and reflect the mentality that you, my fellow reader and potential developer, should avoid.
:::

</br>

::: {.labs}
My porpose is to stablish some patterns of productive thinking to help you to get out from the *Valley of Dispair* a.k.a. (and from now on) **The Pitt** that most likely you would fall into.

</br>

Trust me, I've been there...Actually I AM constantly there, that's why I want to reflect that in this kind of journal.

## Anyway
That's the tricky part, I don't know how as of today (01/19/2023). But hopefully I will.
First of all you need to understand the concept of [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration#Education), my friend. 
With that in mind, we just need to start.

## Albertus' Dylemma... What are we talking about?

You surely noticed the flowchart above. It's such a common pattern for us who just started programming. Have you ever feel identified with it?


As you keep progressing in your coding lessons, problems are going to be slightly more difficult and complex every time. Until you reach to a point when you can't completely see the solution in your mind.  
You'll probably see straight how to get from A to B, but from B to C you see it blurry... Well, then you just have to get to B so you can see more clear how to get to C better, right?  
Yes, I always trick to myself like that...

::: {.callout-note}
## When we talk about **Albertus' Dylemma**:   
It is that moment when you either need to stop, take two steps back and think what led you into this **or** keep hitting the wall (and the keyboard with your pointless code).
