I'm going to try to develop that idea on some exercises **based on this lab:**

::: {.callout appearance="minimal"}
ðŸ“˜ Linux Lab#SE02-1: Movie Review and Rating

    Create a Maven/Gradle Java SE Project.

    Add the needed dependencies:
        Lombok
        Junit
        Java Faker

    Create three Java classes to define the Model. Java SE Classes:

        Movie: The Movie class represents a movie that is being reviewed. It has the following attributes:
            title: a String representing the title of the movie
            reviews: a Set of Review objects representing the reviews that have been written for this movie
            Critic: The Critic class represents a critic who writes reviews.

        The Critic class has the following attributes:
            name: a String representing the name of the critic
            Review: The Review class represents a review of a movie written by a critic.

        The Review class has the following attributes:
            movie: a Movie object representing the movie being reviewed
            critic: a Critic object representing the critic who wrote the review
            rating: an int representing the rating given by the critic (on a scale of 1 to 5)
            comment: a String representing the comment written by the critic about the movie

:::
So I have this requirement:

* Make a program that can manage information about movies such as:
    + Movie name.
    + Its director (e.g. so I can plan a themed marathon with my friends.)
        - Director's prestige: I want to know how many Oscars has the director won through his career.
    + It also needs to include its critics made by the best professionals and to know how well or poorly rated it is.

**User Story #1** - The easiest and certain way to hit the wall.

Let's just start coding:

```{.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="moviemodel.java"}

public Class MovieManager  {
    public static void main(String[])


}

public Class Movie {
    private String title;
    private ArrayList<Review> reviews;
    private Director director;

}

public Class Review {
    private Critic critic;
    private Movie movie;
    private int rating;
    private String comment;


}

public Class Critic {
    private String name;
    private ArrayList<Review> reviews;

}

public Class Director {
    private String name;
    private int oscarQty;
    private ArrayList<Movie> movies;
}


```
