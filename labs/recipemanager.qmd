title: Recipe Manager

I want to make a simple program that stores cooking recipes, create new ones, and in the future could be able to display a weekly menu, or even prepare a shoping list according to that menu.

I've been able only to draw a first classDiagram that I hope to perform in the next weeks:
```{mermaid}
classDiagram
Ingredient o-- Recipe
class Recipe{
    -name: String
    -time: Duration
    -ingredients: Ingredient
    -instruccions: String
    -rating: int
}

class Ingredient{
    -name: String
}




```
