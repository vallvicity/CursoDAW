    "text": "Albertus’ Dylemma… What are we talking about?\nYou surely noticed the flowchart above. It’s such a common pattern for us who just started programming. Have you ever feel identified with it?\nAs you keep progressing in your coding lessons, problems are going to be slightly more difficult and complex every time. Until you reach to a point when you can’t completely see the solution in your mind.\nYou’ll probably see straight how to get from A to B, but from B to C you see it blurry… Well, then you just have to get to B so you can see more clear how to get to C better, right?\nYes, I always trick to myself like that…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about Albertus’ Dylemma:\n\n\n\nIt is that moment when you either need to stop, take two steps back and think what led you into this or keep hitting the wall (and the keyboard with your pointless code).\n\n\nI’m going to try to develop that idea on some exercises based on this lab:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📘 Linux Lab#SE02-1: Movie Review and Rating\nCreate a Maven/Gradle Java SE Project.\n\nAdd the needed dependencies:\n    Lombok\n    Junit\n    Java Faker\n\nCreate three Java classes to define the Model. Java SE Classes:\n\n    Movie: The Movie class represents a movie that is being reviewed. It has the following attributes:\n        title: a String representing the title of the movie\n        reviews: a Set of Review objects representing the reviews that have been written for this movie\n        Critic: The Critic class represents a critic who writes reviews.\n\n    The Critic class has the following attributes:\n        name: a String representing the name of the critic\n        Review: The Review class represents a review of a movie written by a critic.\n\n    The Review class has the following attributes:\n        movie: a Movie object representing the movie being reviewed\n        critic: a Critic object representing the critic who wrote the review\n        rating: an int representing the rating given by the critic (on a scale of 1 to 5)\n        comment: a String representing the comment written by the critic about the movie\n\n\n\nSo I have this requirement:\n\nMake a program that can manage information about movies such as:\n\nMovie name.\nIts director (e.g. so I can plan a themed marathon with my friends.)\n\nDirector’s prestige: I want to know how many Oscars has the director won through his career.\n\nIt also needs to include its critics made by the best professionals and to know how well or poorly rated it is.\n\n\nUser Story #1 - The easiest and certain way to hit the wall.\nLet’s just start coding:\n\npublic Class MovieManager  {\n    public static void main(String[])\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\nA[Problema] --> B[Decision]\nB --> C(Code & See)\nB --> D(Piensa)\nD --> E[Sabes lo que haces?]\nC --> G[El Pozo]\nD --> F[Te enamoraste de tu primera idea?]\nG --> A"
